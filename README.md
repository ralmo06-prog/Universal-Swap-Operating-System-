Universal Swap Operating System – open-source PCM control OS.
# USOS – Universal Swap Operating System

USOS is an open, physics-based engine and transmission control operating system
designed for OEM automotive ECUs. The core goals are transparency, safety,
portability across platforms, and full user control without gatekeeping.

USOS provides a clean-slate, hardware-focused control model that replaces OEM
black-box logic with understandable, measurable, physics-driven behavior
for both engine and transmission systems.

This project is intentionally open-source and designed to stay open forever.

## 🔥 Project Purpose

USOS exists for builders, tuners, reverse-engineers, and engine-swappers who
want an ECU OS they can understand, modify, and trust. Every subsystem is
documented in plain English and structured like a service manual:

- Theory of Operation  
- Conditions → Causes → Corrections → Confirmations  
- Diagnostics and fallback modes  
- Physical model logic (not opaque math blobs)  
- Signal validation and cross-checks  
- Clear safety behavior  
- User-visible learning and trims  

USOS is meant to be studied, modified, and used in the real world.

## 🧩 Current Target Hardware

- GM P01 / P59 ECUs  
- Ford EEC-VI  
- Additional platforms planned as USOS stabilizes  

The architecture is OS-first, not platform-first, so all core logic is portable.
